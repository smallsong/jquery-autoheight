jquery-autoheight
=================

A small jQuery plugin which helps you to make each floated elements same height.

This plugin has only one Parameter, "childrens" parameter.

So an example of that could be ```javascript $("div.columns").autoheight({childrens:"div.child"});``` which defines
the childrens Selector.
